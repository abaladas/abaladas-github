Hi! My name is {{ site.name }}. I'm a **{{ site.role | downcase }}** based in {{ site.location }}, with more than *15 years of experience* using the best tools and techniques.
My favourite are Twitter Bootstrap, Sass, Compass, Drupal, Wordpress, jQuery and a few others.

I have been working as a freelancer and also for small and large companies from different types of industries.

I like to focus on accessible, clean and attractive web solutions that comply with today's web standards.

Get in touch now if you wish to discuss a Web project with me.
