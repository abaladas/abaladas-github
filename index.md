Hi! My name is {{ site.name }}, I'm a **{{ site.role | downcase }}** and **teacher** based in {{ site.location }}. Currently I'm working at [HE:labs][helabs] and before that [enjoei :P][enjoei], [ESPN][espn], [Jornal do Brasil][jb] and [Globo.com][globo].

I'm also creator of [Assando Sites][assando-sites], an online **Ruby on Rails** and **CakePHP** course. I've taught more than *400 developers* new workflows, tools and techniques, through Assando Sites.

Furthermore, I deliver fantastic Ruby on Rails apps using **agile** methodologies. You might say that TDD and CI are my things. I have been developing web apps for more than 15 years and I love working with **open-source back-end** tools.

I'm also a proud member of [DojoRio][dojorio], a *coding dojo* group.

*[TDD]: Test Driven Development
*[CI]: Continuous Integration
